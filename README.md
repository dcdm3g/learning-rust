# Learning Rust

TypeScript is my main programming language and **I don't intead to change it at the moment**, but I got really curious bacause of how fond other developers are of the Rust programming language, so I created this repository to view Rust in action solving some basic challenges from [Codewars](https://codewars.com).

I'm just testing Rust for fun at the moment, but I'd really like to use it to build some web applications or contribute to awesome tools like [NextJS](https://nextjs.org) that have Rust files in their GitHub repositories.

## Run Yourself

> To run this application, you need to have Rust installed on your machine. If you haven't installed it yet, you can follow [this guide](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install) from the official Rust documentation.

The `src` folder contains the files with solutions to the challenges, including unit tests. You can run the tests using:

```sh
cargo test
# or
cargo t
```

The `main.rs` file serves as an entry point to the challenge files. You can run it to see a cool message with:

```sh
cargo run
```
